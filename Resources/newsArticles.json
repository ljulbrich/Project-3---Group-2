Public Ventures President and Chief Market Strategist Lou Basenese joins Yahoo Finance in-studio to talk about tech stock leaders with broadening use cases for artificial intelligence, highlighting Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Apple (AAPL) \"You have to play a basket. You're not going to be able to pick a single horse in this AI race and work out as well as it did for Nvidia (NVDA) last year,\" Basenese says. \"Let's just face it, Nvidia can't have the same run... this year as it did last year.
